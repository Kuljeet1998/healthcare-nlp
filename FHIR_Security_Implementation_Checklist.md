# FHIR Security Implementation Checklist

## Phase 1: Foundation Security (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Set up OAuth 2.0 authorization server
- [ ] Implement SMART on FHIR authentication flow
- [ ] Configure JWT token validation
- [ ] Set up basic RBAC framework
- [ ] Enable TLS 1.3 for all endpoints
- [ ] Implement basic audit logging

## Phase 2: Advanced Security (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Deploy comprehensive audit logging system
- [ ] Set up real-time security monitoring
- [ ] Implement data encryption at rest
- [ ] Configure network segmentation
- [ ] Deploy API gateway with rate limiting
- [ ] Set up vulnerability scanning

## Phase 3: Compliance & Monitoring (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Complete HIPAA risk assessment
- [ ] Implement incident response procedures
- [ ] Set up compliance reporting dashboards
- [ ] Deploy anomaly detection system
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing
- [ ] Staff security training program

## Phase 4: Optimization & Maintenance (Ongoing)
- [ ] Regular security assessments
- [ ] Continuous compliance monitoring
- [ ] Security policy updates
- [ ] Staff training refreshers
- [ ] Technology stack updates
- [ ] Threat intelligence integration

## Critical Security Components

### Authentication Stack
```typescript
// Example OAuth 2.0 + SMART on FHIR implementation
interface SmartAuthConfig {
  authorizationEndpoint: string;
  tokenEndpoint: string;
  clientId: string;
  scope: string[];
  redirectUri: string;
}
```

### Audit Logging
```typescript
// Comprehensive audit event structure
interface AuditEvent {
  timestamp: Date;
  userId: string;
  action: string;
  resource: FHIRResource;
  outcome: 'success' | 'failure';
  riskScore: number;
}
```

### Access Control
```typescript
// RBAC implementation
interface Permission {
  resource: string;
  actions: ('read' | 'write' | 'delete')[];
  conditions?: AccessCondition[];
}
```
