## ðŸ§ª Test Results Analysis

### Most Effective Examples:
1. **Emergency Query**: "severe chest pain and difficulty breathing" 
   - Confidence: 0.92
   - Correctly identified as emergency (5/5 urgency)
   - Proper respiratory specialty detection

2. **Diabetic Patient Search**: "diabetic patients over 50 with glucose measurements"
   - Confidence: 0.93
   - Excellent entity extraction and FHIR query generation
   - Proper endocrinology specialty assignment

3. **Patient-Specific Query**: "blood pressure observations for John Smith"
