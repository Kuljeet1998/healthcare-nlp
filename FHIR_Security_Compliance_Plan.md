# FHIR Healthcare Query Service - Security & Compliance Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security architecture and HIPAA compliance strategy for the FHIR Healthcare Query Service, ensuring secure handling of Protected Health Information (PHI) while maintaining system functionality and user experience.

## 1. HIPAA Compliance Framework

### 1.1 Administrative Safeguards
- **Security Officer**: Designated HIPAA Security Officer responsible for security policies and procedures
- **Workforce Training**: Regular security awareness training for all personnel with PHI access
- **Access Management**: Formal process for granting, modifying, and revoking access to PHI
- **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for security incident detection, response, and reporting

### 1.2 Physical Safeguards
- **Data Center Security**: Cloud infrastructure with SOC 2 Type II compliance (AWS/Azure)
- **Workstation Controls**: Secure development environments with encrypted storage
- **Device Controls**: Mobile device management (MDM) for any devices accessing PHI

### 1.3 Technical Safeguards
- **Access Control**: Multi-factor authentication and role-based access control
- **Audit Controls**: Comprehensive logging of all PHI access and modifications
- **Integrity Controls**: Data validation and checksums to prevent unauthorized alterations
- **Transmission Security**: End-to-end encryption for all data in transit

## 2. Authentication & Authorization Architecture

### 2.1 SMART on FHIR Implementation
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Client App    │◄──►│  Authorization   │◄──►│  FHIR Server    │
│  (Frontend)     │    │     Server       │    │   (Backend)     │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                        │                        │
         ▼                        ▼                        ▼
   OAuth 2.0 Flow         JWT Token Validation      Resource Access
```

### 2.2 OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect Flow
1. **Authorization Request**: Client redirects user to authorization server
2. **User Authentication**: User authenticates via secure identity provider
3. **Authorization Grant**: User consents to specific FHIR resource access
4. **Token Exchange**: Client receives access token and refresh token
5. **Resource Access**: API calls include Bearer token for authentication

### 2.3 Token Management
- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived (15-30 minutes) JWT tokens with specific scopes
- **Refresh Tokens**: Longer-lived tokens for seamless re-authentication
- **Token Revocation**: Immediate token invalidation for security incidents
- **Scope Granularity**: Fine-grained permissions (e.g., `patient/*.read`, `user/Observation.read`)

## 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### 3.1 User Roles & Permissions Matrix

| Role | Patient Data | Observations | Medications | Diagnostic Reports | Admin Functions |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Physician** | Full Access | Full Access | Full Access | Full Access | Read-Only |
| **Nurse** | Limited Access | Full Access | Read-Only | Read-Only | None |
| **Researcher** | De-identified Only | Aggregate Only | Aggregate Only | Aggregate Only | None |
| **Administrator** | Audit Logs Only | Configuration | Configuration | Configuration | Full Access |
| **Patient** | Own Data Only | Own Data Only | Own Data Only | Own Data Only | None |

### 3.2 Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- **Contextual Access**: Time-based, location-based, and device-based restrictions
- **Dynamic Permissions**: Real-time evaluation of access requests
- **Break-Glass Access**: Emergency access with enhanced logging and approval workflows

### 3.3 Implementation Strategy
```typescript
interface AccessControl {
  userId: string;
  roles: Role[];
  permissions: Permission[];
  context: {
    timestamp: Date;
    ipAddress: string;
    deviceId: string;
    location?: GeoLocation;
  };
}

class FHIRAuthorizationService {
  async authorizeRequest(
    user: User, 
    resource: FHIRResource, 
    action: 'read' | 'write' | 'delete'
  ): Promise<AuthorizationResult> {
    // Multi-layer authorization check
    return this.evaluatePermissions(user, resource, action);
  }
}
```

## 4. Data Privacy & Protection Strategy

### 4.1 Data Encryption
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored PHI
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **In Memory**: Encrypted memory allocation for sensitive data processing
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for encryption key storage

### 4.2 Data De-identification
- **Safe Harbor Method**: Removal of 18 identifiers per HIPAA Safe Harbor
- **Expert Determination**: Statistical disclosure control for research datasets
- **Synthetic Data**: AI-generated datasets for development and testing

### 4.3 Data Minimization
- **Purpose Limitation**: Collect only data necessary for specific use cases
- **Retention Policies**: Automated data purging based on regulatory requirements
- **Query Optimization**: Limit data exposure in API responses

## 5. Comprehensive Audit Logging Strategy

### 5.1 Audit Event Categories
```json
